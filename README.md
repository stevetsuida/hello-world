# hello-world
The optional short description for a first GitHub repository.
Hey there, I'm learning GitHub today, and a part of that process is to go through the tutorials. Today's tutorial is about greating branches, which remind me a lot of the snapshot feature in FInal Cut Pro. Oh, an dnow that I kow what GitHub is, I think I want to try out the GitHub integration in Coda, too!
